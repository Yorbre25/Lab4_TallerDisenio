# VGAController
This a VGA controller made for FPGA and in System Verilog Hardware Description Language wich shows sprites and is connected to finite state machine that works as a game manager for a TIC TAC TOE game.
This project has only the .sv files and you must create your own project in your computer(Quartus or another tool).
The top file is called vga.sv, and you have to connect the vga pin into your FPGA to watch the result.
The result must be a Tic tac toe, and depend on your pin configuration you can move around with a push button and select the square you want with another push button.
There are two sprites ROM, Rick and Morty.
This is a 8 bit r,g,b project if you have a different configuration you have to change it into the .sv files.
